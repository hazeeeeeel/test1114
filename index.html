        <!-- <p class="text-content">Much of a climber‚Äôs day is actually spent off the rock, but nevertheless immersed in the practice. Conversational topics include what was climbed that day, troubleshooting with fellow climbers regarding difficult sequences, potential new routes to ‚Äòproject‚Äô (begin working on), newly discovered cliff lines, future travel plans, and so on. Discussion of routes climbed, in particular, includes recitation of portions or even the entire route, from the starting holds through the crux to the anchors, thereby illustrating the essential elements of narrative ‚Äì setting, plot, characters, and so on. Witnessing such a narrative display between climbers in her fieldwork, Ness explains, ‚Äòthey moved between linguistic and gestural forms of representation with a fluency that indexed their combined extensive practice‚Äô.64 That is, climbers in conversation communicate spatial associations not only through practice-specific jargon but also require the ‚Äòmore-than-representational‚Äô,65 in the form of non-linguistic sounds and gestures, to convey meaning. </p>
        <p class="text-content">Gesture, in this sense, is taken from the Lefebvrean notion as a means through which the body determines and communicates space. Most broadly, a gesture is a bodily movement ‚Äòwhich modifies a person‚Äôs orientation and points of reference. The word is preferable to ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù for a gestural action has a goal or aim (which is not, of course, to imply some immanent teleology)‚Äô.66 A gesture could be a pointing finger or it may be turning one‚Äôs head at the sound of a sudden noise, both of which indicate or make reference to an action. As such, gestures are more-than-representational; they communicate beyond the limitations of vocabulary.67 In the case of climbing narratives, the teller combines verbal descriptions with the physical performance of parts of the routes (see Figure 2). S/he employs gestures in the form of mimicking hand and body movements of the moves described, accompanied by sounds ‚Äì grunts, gasps, and cheers ‚Äì to indicate the difficulty and style of movement on the rock. In fact, one can glean the types of handholds that compose the route in the hand formations exhibited ‚Äì wide open hands for a ‚Äòjug‚Äô, a tight-fingered gesture for a ‚Äòcrimper‚Äô, or an outstretched finger for a ‚Äòmono-pocket‚Äô. Narrating the route communicates one‚Äôs intimate knowledge, or ‚Äòcorporeal knowing‚Äô,68 of the rock face and provides ‚Äòbeta‚Äô (helpful information regarding types and locations of holds and body placement to successfully complete the route) to fellow climbers. This is both an imaginative and physical enactment, but also a narrative performance of space requiring performer and audience. As such, narration of the spatial practice of climbing produces a storied space, a representational space, while gestures extend to the more-than-representational. Indeed, Somdahl-Sands69 argues this is necessarily so. While on the rock face, in the performance of climbing, the body is engaged with perceived space and as such it acts. Cognition and action cannot take place simultaneously. Cognition either informs movement or makes sense of it after the fact. When the body is in motion, it is in action. In narrating a route, a climber cognizes the spatial practice of climbing and, in so doing, commits the choreography of the route to memory, producing a representational space. </p>
        <p class="text-content">Gestural systems function as performative language.70 This is an insight that was developed by Goffman,71 in particular, who understands the body as a material resource for communication. Social interaction requires more than verbal communication; as such bodily gestures are necessarily employed. Examining the relationship between the production of space and such gestural systems, Lefebvre states, ‚Äògestures as a whole mobilize and activate the total body‚Äô, and in so doing they are not simply performed in space, but ‚Äòbodies themselves generate spaces, which are produced by and for their gestures‚Äô.72 Through gestures the social production of climbing space extends well beyond the rock face to the social spaces where climbers gather and camp. These social spaces are filled with conversations of climbing, conversations that require more than verbal communication to relate the spatial practice (perceived space) of the route. Words mix with bodily movements and mimicking gestures, from handholds to bodily postures, as well as non-verbal sounds. Gestural systems produce another type of climbing space, a representational space that relates the spatial practice of rock climbing and the more-than-representational lived experience of the route, with the imagined spaces of the listener/viewer of the narration. </p>
        <p class="text-content">Yet, gestural systems also ‚Äòembody ideology and bind it to practice‚Äô, and in so doing, they connect the representational spaces of narration to representations of space.73 In other words, ideology works not just by influencing one‚Äôs thoughts, but informing one‚Äôs actions. As performative language, gestural systems make use of symbols, signs, and signals that denote affiliation. Goffman, writing on this matter, posited that the body and its employment of gestures mediates one‚Äôs self identity and social identity, as gestures function as shared vocabularies. In the case of rock climb-ing, the use of gestures to accompany descriptive language produces both conceived and lived spaces far from the rock face where the spatial practice takes place. This is a social space in which only those familiar with the embodied, spatial practice of climbing can actively communicate and make use of the information shared in the gestural signal. It is a space associated with signs and codes, the use of which connects these representations of space to the imagined (representational) space of the listener/viewer through the more-than-representational communication of gestures. Through the continual telling of narratives of spatial practice, which employ gestures, they have the power to influence the way other climbers approach respective routes. In this way, gestures further ideology, informing the conceived and perceived spaces of the rock face. </p> -->
